- exam 1 questions are always based on the transcript - what the professor discussed in the lecture, important points etc. and exam 2 should be from university exam questions you searched from the web.

# Answer Format Guidelines for Study Materials

When creating answered versions of exams, follow this ADHD-friendly approach:

## Structure Requirements
- Use color-coded answers: Green for main answers, blue for detailed explanations
- Break down complex concepts into step-by-step explanations
- Always provide context - never leave room for confusion or ambiguity
- Use friendly tone but avoid metaphors that might confuse
- Include mathematical derivations with clear intermediate steps

## LaTeX Template for Answered Exams
```latex
% Define colors for answers
\definecolor{answercolor}{RGB}{0,100,0}
\definecolor{explanationcolor}{RGB}{0,0,139}

% Custom commands for answers
\newcommand{\answer}[1]{{\color{answercolor}\textbf{Answer:} #1}}
\newcommand{\explanation}[1]{{\color{explanationcolor}#1}}
```

## Content Guidelines
1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Every concept explained from first principles
2. **Clear Context**: Always explain WHY concepts work, not just HOW
3. **Real Examples**: Use actual numbers from real networks (AlexNet, ResNet, etc.)
4. **Mathematical Rigor**: Show all calculations and derivations
5. **Practical Connections**: Link theory to real-world applications
6. **Memory Aids**: Use structured lists and clear organization
7. **No Ambiguity**: Define all terms and variables clearly

## Answer Structure
- **Main Answer**: Direct response to the question
- **Detailed Explanation**: Step-by-step breakdown with reasoning
- **Examples**: Concrete calculations or scenarios
- **Key Insights**: Important takeaways highlighted
- **Connections**: Links to related concepts

This format helps students with ADHD by providing:
- Clear visual separation of information
- Multiple levels of detail
- Structured, organized content
- Context for every concept
- Friendly, supportive tone
